# COSC224-Lab-2

Create a BRANCH for your animal subset

Chris - Mammals
Miriam - Fish
Ben - Birds
Matt - Reptiles

Add a file - "animal".txt to your branch. Do not pull anything from the master.
Add 1 animal to your file. Commit it with comment "Name added Animal"

Pull your branch change to the master. 

Check out another branch when the filename from that branch appears in the master (i.e. if you see birds, go to birds branch and add a bird to birds.txt. Do not pull from master to birds. Only birds.txt should be in birds branch).
